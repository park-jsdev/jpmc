# Data Visualization Feature
There are the patch files created for the JP Morgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience.
It was a short online, modular, and free project that rewarded a certificate of completion.
The project's premise was implementing a functionality request from a trader from the equities team to be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.
It was a good learning experience for seeing the work flow of software engineers at JPMC, and an introduction to some of the technologies they use. The coding portion was almost entirely guided.
The main tasks were:
- Establishing Financial Data Feeds
- Frontend Web Development
- Data Visualization with Perspective

The key takeaways were:
- Setting up the work environment, I used Windows
- Simulated engineer workflow, consisting of:
  - receiving an engineering ticket, with purpose, and acceptance criteria
  - git clone repo
  - install dependencies / npm packages
  - server application in terminal
  - code solution in text editor, add comments and reasoning
  - perform unit testing and assertions
  - generate patch file
  - submit patch file
  
- Introduced to React State and Lifecycle
- Introduced to DOM
- Introduced to JP Morgan Chase's Perspective API
